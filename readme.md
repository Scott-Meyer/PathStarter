# Project Path Starter!

This project serves two purposes for me.

##First - To live.
I hate when I die because I forgot to turn on my logout macro

##Second - To learn.
I graduated collage less than a year ago and got a job at a large company which uses Java.

My school had very little Object Orented, and we mostly used Racket (LISP). The company that I now work for
uses a stupidly overly complex OO style that I can still barely navigate. Their system uses dynamic loading of
java class files, which are stored in "databases" and has tons of dynamic and overlapping properties and settings
and its just overall hell.

I decided to make a personal project in Java which (unnessicerally) utilizes all of these things. Properties, dynamic properties,
dynamic java classes as objects, singletons, logging, etc...

PLEASE feel free to give me tons of feedback.
